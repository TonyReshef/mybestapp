**Your BEST Web Application**

🌟** Project Overview**
This is a secure, simple web application developed as part of a cybersecurity and web development learning exercise. 
The project demonstrates best practices in web development, AI-assisted coding, and information security.

🎯 **Project Goals**
- Create a functional (BEST) WEB Application
- Implement secure coding practices
- Utilize AI tools responsibly in software development
- Practice version control with GitHub (open GitHub account and store the code in public repo)
- Understand basic security principles (create report from code scan)

🛠 **Technologies Used**
- Any dev languge - GO, Python, JS, C++, Ruby, HTML, etc
- GitHub
- AI-assisted development tools

🔒 **Security Considerations**

**Information Protection**
- No hardcoded API keys or sensitive information
- Using `.env` for environment variables
- `.gitignore` configured to prevent accidental secret exposure

**Code Security Scanning**
- Utilized GitHub Secret Scanning (or other tool)
- Ran security checks with open-source tools
- Verified no sensitive information leaked

🤖 **AI Development Process**
**AI Assistance**
- Used AI tools to generate initial code structure
- Manually reviewed and understood all generated code
- Learned from AI suggestions while maintaining code ownership

🚀 **Local Development Setup**

**Prerequisites**
- Modern web browser (Chrome)
- Text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
- GitHub
- (Optional) Node.js for more advanced setups

🔍 **Code Scanning Results**
- Provide detailed report

📜 **License**
- Choose an appropriate open-source license, e.g., MIT
